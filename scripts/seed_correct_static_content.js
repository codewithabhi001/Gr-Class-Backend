    <p><strong>Effective Date: May 17, 2026</strong></p>
    <p>
        These Terms govern all classification, statutory, and environmental survey services provided by GR Class to shipowners, charterers, and managers. 
        By scheduling a survey or utilizing our certificates, you agree to these conditions.
    </p>
    <h3 style="color: #1b4f72; margin-top: 20px;">1. Standards of Performance</h3>
    <p>
        All surveys are conducted by certified GR Class surveyors with professional integrity. However, classification and certification do not relieve 
        the owner of their primary responsibility to maintain the vessel in a seaworthy condition.
    </p>
    <h3 style="color: #1b4f72; margin-top: 20px;">2. Access to Vessels</h3>
    <p>Shipowners must provide GR Class surveyors with safe, unobstructed access to the vessel, including dry-dock spaces, tanks, and structural compartments, along with complete technical documentation.</p>
