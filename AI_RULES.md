# GR-CLASS MARINE BACKEND – AI RULE FILE

This file serves as the definitive guide for AI assistants and developers working on the GR-CLASS Marine Backend. All code generation, architectural decisions, and API designs MUST adhere to these rules.

## 1. Core System Purpose
The system manages marine certification and vessel compliance with legal-grade auditability.
**Primary Goals**: Traceable decisions, Verifiable evidence, Role-secure operations, Regulatory alignment, Operational reliability.

## 2. Architectural Principles
### 2.1 Modular by Domain
*   Structure folders by business domain (`modules/jobs`, `modules/certificates`), NOT by role.
*   Roles control access, not code structure.

### 2.2 API-First Design
*   Every feature must be exposed via REST API.
*   Must include Input/Output schemas, Validation, System Events, and Audit Logs.
*   No "hidden logic".

## 3. Access Control Rules
### 3.1 Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
*   All endpoints must declare allowed roles via middleware (e.g., `hasRole('ADMIN')`).
*   Violations return `403 Forbidden`.

### 3.2 Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC)
*   Use dynamic policies where roles are insufficient (e.g., "Surveyor sees only assigned vessels").
*   Policies must be stored in DB and evaluated dynamically, never hardcoded.

## 4. Capabilities Over Roles
*   Backend must return specific `capabilities` (e.g., `["CERT_SIGN", "JOB_ESCALATE"]`).
*   Frontend UI visibility is driven by capabilities, not raw role strings.

## 5. Data Integrity Rules
### 5.1 No Hard Deletes
*   Core entities (Jobs, Certificates, Evidence) use `deleted_at` or `status='ARCHIVED'`.

### 5.2 Immutable Evidence
*   Evidence linked to certificates or legal holds is **Read-Only**.
*   Allowed actions: Read, Verify, Lock.

## 6. Audit & Event Rules
### 6.1 Critical Events
*   Mandatory events for: Certificate Issue/Revoke, Survey Submit, Evidence Lock, SLA Breach, Force Logout.
*   No silent state changes.

### 6.2 Mandatory Audit Trail
*   Log: **Who** did **What** on **Which Entity** at **When** from **Where**.
*   Logs must be immutable and exportable.

## 7. SLA Rules
*   Every Job has an SLA.
*   Pause/Resume/Override actions must be logged with justification.
*   Breaches trigger notifications to GM & Admin.

## 8. Security Rules
### 8.1 Session Control
*   Track Device + IP + User Agent.
*   Support Force Logout and Token Revocation.

### 8.2 Verify Everything
*   Never trust client claims or timestamps.
*   Verify GPS with AIS. Recalculate file hashes.

## 9. Compliance & Legal Rules
### 9.1 Legal Hold Supremacy
*   **Legal Hold** blocks ALL deletion, modification, and anonymization.

### 9.2 GDPR
*   Anonymization removes PII but preserves referential integrity and audit logs.

## 10. Database Rules
*   **Versioned Tables**: Certificates, Evidence, Templates.
*   **No Logic**: DB holds state; Logic lives in services.

## 11. API Behavior Rules
*   **Predictable Errors**: Standard error codes (e.g., `CERT_REVOKED`).
*   **Idempotency**: Required for critical endpoints (payments, uploads).

## 12. Background Job Rules
*   Async jobs must be retryable, observable, and have dead-letter queues.

## 13. AI-Specific Rules
*   AI generation MUST respect RBAC/ABAC, emit events, and log audits.
*   AI MUST NEVER bypass validation or hardcode business rules.

## 14. Frontend ↔ Backend Contract
*   Backend provides: Capabilities, State Machine, Audit Visibility.
*   Frontend assumes: Nothing about DB/Roles; Mutates via API only.

## 15. Naming & Versioning
*   APIs versioned (`/api/v1`).
*   Backward compatible.
*   DB columns never renamed without migration.

## 16. Final Principle
**If a feature cannot be audited, verified, or justified legally, it does not belong in this system.**
